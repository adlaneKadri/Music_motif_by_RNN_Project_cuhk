# MMRNN
MMRNN (Music Motif generator Recurrent Neuron Network) is a music generator which you can input your song into this model
and get the short piece of generated music from the model. You can create your own music based on the generated music as a motif.

At first, I made this model for my Deep Learning course in CUHK.

### Dependancies

### Training time for this model
It takes around 2-3 hours to train in this deep model on AWS p2.xlarge (1 GPU).
